\title{Consensus Time in Preferential Rewiring Model}

\section{Model}
As discussed last week, an Agent chosen to update either updates his opinion (with probability $\phi$) to agree with the majority of his neighbors or rewires a link (with probability $1-\phi$). We have homophilic respectively heterophilic agents who rewire to agents with the same respectively different opinions. The density of heterophilic agents is $\eta$. The rewiring is done preferentially like in the generative process for BA networks: the probability that an node (or agent) receives the new link is proportional to the degree of the node. Initially we use a BA network with 100 Agents and attachment parameter $m=2$\footnote{Here this is actually an important parameter. If it is even, there will be a more tie situation than when it is odd. Opinions therefore change less often and the consensus time is expected to increase. Some preliminary results suggest that the consensus time is a bout an order of magnitude higher when $m=2$ as opposed to $m=3$.}.
